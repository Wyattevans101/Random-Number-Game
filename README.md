# Random-Number-Game

This game was made in C++, and it uses a random number generator which then picks a number and displays it in the test line (It is added to help show what 
the game can do, please comment it out if you want to actually play). This game also helps with the use of switches along with some while and do while loops

All in all a pretty great little game that I had fun making!
